> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project is under active development and may have bugs. Inspired by PopClip, Iâ€™m building an open-source alternative with plans to fully support its plugin system (currently limited). As this is my first Swift project, the code will evolve as I learn and improve. Feedback is welcome!

## What is Xpop?

Xpop is a utility tool for Mac that pops up a menu with multiple actions when text is selected in **any application**.

The action features of Xpop are quite extensive, ranging from simple **copy-paste** and **web searches** to more complex operations. Xpop offers an easy-to-use **plugin system**, allowing developers to easily create and implement the functionalities they desire.

Xpop is a **free** and **open-source software**, and anyone can view and obtain its source code on GitHub. You can consider it as an alternative to PopClip, with **partial compatibility with its plugin system**. PopClip is an excellent software that I highly admire.

Xpop is exclusively designed for the **Mac platform** and is written in Swift. I hope that this native application will deliver an even better user experience.
